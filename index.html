<p>I am currently a nomad. And this past 2016 I traveled most of the west coast. Which was indescribably amazing on so many different layers. I learned much more than I could have imagined and did quite a bit of soul searching. Or meditation, I get the two mixed up often enough. I had been dreaming of going to Mars for a couple months before seeing my first launch from Vandenberg AFB but seeing my first launch...I was at a complete loss for words. Sitting on the ocean I teared up seeing that bright red light fall across the sky and the cogs in my mind ground to a halt. And as I continued watching the livestream on my phone I couldn't get over the thought that so many more launches were to come. About a month or two later I drove out to Florida(where I currently am, but that'll change soon enough I am sure). I have now seen three more launches, one being the first ever reflown booster. I was twelve miles away and again I became more motivated to travel to Mars in the coming decade..or two. I am sharing this because one person can not achieve their goals alone.</p>

<p>I have traveled the west coast, and hopefully by the end of 2017 and begining of 2018 I will have traveled the east coast. After that, I am trying to start bike touring outside of the US. When I left in 2016 out to California I had only read about living the nomadic vehicular lifestyle. Some videos, blogs, a free ebook or two had been my only exposure to the idea. I found out as a very logical introvert this lifestyle didn't just fit me, it was like seeing clouds for the very first time. Every morning and evening felt like a brand new day. To be lived in the moment, ever changing. Before I left I thought I feared change, and what I have learned is that I seek it. When I left I knew that SpaceX had the launch from Vandenberg scheduled, but I wasn't sure if I'd still be there when it happned. It was my intention to see it if I could, but if not. Not a big deal. Over the course of the year I worked multiple jobs. Tried some of the best food I have ever had in my life. Saw some amazing musicians, and beautiful venues. I took a little over a full month to travel, and talked to some wonderful people. And most of all, the ocean. I've fallen in love with the ocean on many different levels. The sound being my favorite, it is like a soft constent mediation. My travels outside the US will be planned along the ocean coasts as often as I can afford.
</p> 
<p>Scale or ratio is something I find incredible and as someone who learns by seeing and doing; traveling has felt like adding a new terabyte hard drive to my brain every month. Ideally by the end of Febuary of 2018 is when I'd like to start bike touring. I am hoping that the SpaceX satellite constelation is semi up and running which would allow for much better reliable internet accsess while traveling. Thus more reliable work for clients during that time. I've been either working traditional jobs or day labor and I think it is time to flex my wings a little. I plan on starting with freelancing website and illustration. After I establish some clients I would like to move into adding programming, mainly mobile focused. I also have skills in editing, animation, and the general Adobe pipeline.

<p>I am sure there are hundreds of millions of people who can imagine what life on Mars would be like. I take a very minimalist view when it comes to the physical aspect. The technology side however is rife with oportunites. Recording zero g movie shots on green screen would be cheaper than ever while in the two month transit. And even the thirty percent of earths gravity on Mars would allow for very unique movie shots and a host of other possibilities that I am incredibly excited for. The audio recordings that will be captured will be the first of their kind and unique in the most marvelous of ways. Meditation and the effect different gravity would have on our mood and phycology will be incredible to witness and feel first hand. How that would change productivity, work proformance and a host of other things would be invaluble data that I am very much looking forward to collecting on myself.</p>
