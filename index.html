<a id="welcome-to-my-portfolio-slash-website!" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi, my names Alex. Welcome to my corner of the internet!</h3>

<p>I am currently a nomad. And this past 2016 I traveled most of the west coast. Which was indescribably amazing on so many different layers. I learned much more than I could have imagined and did quite a bit of soul searching. Or meditation, I get the two mixed up often enough. I had been dreaming of going to Mars for a couple months before seeing my first launch from Vandenberg AFB but seeing my first launch...I was at a complete loss for words. Sitting on the ocean I teared up seeing that bright red light fall across the sky and the cogs in my mind ground to a halt. And as I continued watching the livestream on my phone I couldn't get over the thought that so many more launches were to come. About a month or two later I drove out to Florida(where I currently am, but that'll change soon enough I'm sure). I have now seen three more launches, one being the first ever reflown booster. I was twelve miles away and again I became more motivated to travel to Mars in the coming decade..or two. I am sharing this goal because one person alone can not achieve their goals alone.</p>

<p>I have traveled the west coast, and hopefully by the end of 2017 and begining of 2018 I will have traveled the east coast. After that I am trying to start bike touring outside of the US. When I left in 2016 out to California I had only read about living the nomadic vehicular lifestyle. Some videos, blogs, a free ebook or two had been my only exposure to the idea. I found out as a very logical introvert this lifestyle didn't just fit me, it was like seeing clouds for the very first time. Every morning and evening felt like a brand new day. To be lived in the moment, ever changing. Before I left I thought I feared change, and what I have learned is that I seek it. When I left I new that SpaceX had the launch from Vandenberg scheduled, but I wasn't sure if I'd still be there when it happned. It was my intention to see it if I could, but if not. Not a big deal. Over the course of the year I worked multiple jobs, which taught me a ton. Tried some of the best food I have ever had in my life. I saw some amazing musicians, and beautiful venues. And most of all, the ocean. I've fallen in love with the ocean on many different levels. The sound being the top. My travels outside the US will be along the oceans as often as I can afford. I took a full month to travel, and talked to many wonderfully nice people. </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
